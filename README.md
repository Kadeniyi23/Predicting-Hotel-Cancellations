# üè® Predicting Hotel Cancellations
## üìå Project Overview
A hotel is looking to increase revenue by reducing the number of booking cancellations. The goal of this project is to analyze booking data and predict which reservations are likely to be canceled, allowing the hotel to take proactive steps such as offering discounts or overbooking management.

This project applies data exploration, visualization, and machine learning techniques to uncover patterns and build a predictive model.

## üìÇ Dataset Details
The dataset consists of hotel booking records, including information on guests, booking details, previous cancellations, special requests, and pricing.
